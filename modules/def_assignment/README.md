# POLICY DEFINITION ASSIGNMENT MODULE

Assignments can be scoped from overarching management groups right down to individual resources.

> ðŸ’¡ A role assignment and remediation task will be automatically created if the Policy Definition contains a list of `roleDefinitionIds`. This can be omitted with `skip_role_assignment = true`, or to assign roles at a different scope to that of the policy assignment use: `role_assignment_scope`. To successfully create Role-assignments (or group memberships) the deployment account may require the [User Access Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator) role at the `assignment_scope` or preferably the `definition_scope` to simplify workflows.

## Examples

### Assign a definition with Modify effect to automatically create a role assignment and remediation task

```hcl
module team_a_mg_inherit_resource_group_tags_modify {
  source            = "gettek/policy-as-code/azurerm//modules/def_assignment"
  definition        = module.inherit_resource_group_tags_modify.definition
  assignment_scope  = data.azurerm_management_group.team_a.id
  assignment_effect = "Modify"
  skip_remediation  = var.skip_remediation

  assignment_parameters = {
    tagName = "environment"
  }
}
```

### Assign a definition with Modify effect to automatically create a role assignment and remediation task with an explicit role

```hcl
data azurerm_role_definition contributor {
  name = "Contributor"
}

module team_a_mg_inherit_resource_group_tags_modify {
  source            = "gettek/policy-as-code/azurerm//modules/def_assignment"
  definition        = module.inherit_resource_group_tags_modify.definition
  assignment_scope  = data.azurerm_management_group.team_a.id
  assignment_effect = "Modify"
  skip_remediation  = var.skip_remediation

  # specify a list of role definitions or omit to use those defined in the policies
  role_definition_ids = [
    data.azurerm_role_definition.contributor.id
  ]

  # specify a different role assignment scope or omit to use the policy assignment scope
  role_assignment_scope = data.azurerm_management_group.team_a.id

  assignment_parameters = {
    tagName = "environment"
  }
}
```

### Create a Built-In Policy Definition Assignment with Custom Non-Compliance Message

```hcl
# Should use name instead of display name, as Microsoft changes the display names.
data azurerm_policy_definition_built_in deploy_law_on_linux_vms {
  name =  "053d3325-282c-4e5c-b944-24faffd30d77" #"Deploy Log Analytics extension for Linux VMs"
}

module team_a_mg_deploy_law_on_linux_vms {
  source            = "gettek/policy-as-code/azurerm//modules/def_assignment"
  definition        = data.azurerm_policy_definition_built_in.deploy_law_on_linux_vms
  assignment_scope  = data.azurerm_management_group.team_a.id
  skip_remediation  = var.skip_remediation

  assignment_parameters = {
    logAnalytics           = local.dummy_resource_ids.azurerm_log_analytics_workspace
    listOfImageIdToInclude = [
      local.dummy_resource_ids.custom_linux_image_id
    ]
  }

  non_compliance_message = "Example non-compliance message will be used as opposed to default policy error"
}
```

### Assign a definition with Modify effect but add identity to an AAD Group instead of role-assignment

```hcl
data "azuread_group" "policy_remediation" {
  display_name     = "policy_remediation"
  security_enabled = true
}

module team_a_mg_inherit_resource_group_tags_modify {
  source               = "gettek/policy-as-code/azurerm//modules/def_assignment"
  definition           = module.inherit_resource_group_tags_modify.definition
  assignment_scope     = data.azurerm_management_group.team_a.id
  skip_remediation     = false
  skip_role_assignment = true # <- set this to true to avoid role assignments

  assignment_parameters = {
    tagName = "environment"
  }
}

resource "azuread_group_member" "remediate_team_a_mg_inherit_resource_group_tags_modify" {
  group_object_id  = data.azuread_group.policy_remediation.id
  member_object_id = module.team_a_mg_inherit_resource_group_tags_modify.principal_id
}
```

### Resource selectors (preview)

The optional `resource_selectors` property facilitates safe deployment practices (SDP) by enabling you to gradually roll out policy assignments based on factors like resource location, resource type, or whether a resource has a location.

> ðŸ“˜ [Microsoft Docs: Azure Policy assignment structure (Resource selectors)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/assignment-structure#resource-selectors-preview)

The example below demonstrates the acceptable format for this module:

```hcl
module "org_mg_whitelist_regions" {
  source            = "gettek/policy-as-code/azurerm//modules/def_assignment"
  definition        = module.whitelist_regions.definition
  assignment_scope  = data.azurerm_management_group.org.id
  assignment_effect = "Deny"

  assignment_parameters = {
    listOfRegionsAllowed = [ "uk", "uksouth", "ukwest", "europe", "northeurope", "westeurope", "global" ]
  }

  # optional resource selectors (preview)
  resource_selectors = [
    {
      name = "SDPRegions"
      selectors = {
        kind = "resourceLocation"
        in = [ "uk", "uksouth", "ukwest" ]
      }
    },
    {
      name = "SDPResourceTypes"
      selectors = {
        kind = "resourceType"
        in = [ "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts", "Microsoft.EventHub/namespaces", "Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces" ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
